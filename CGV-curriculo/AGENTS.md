# CGV — agent entry point (method side)

This repo holds the **method**. The products live in `curriculo/`, one folder per course.



## Read before acting

Three documents, three altitudes. Each owns its rules; none repeats another.

1. **`cgv_hermeneutical_constitution_draft.md`** — *why, and what may never happen.* The
   non-negotiables, the three observation layers, the drift tests, genre.
2. **`WORKFLOW.md`** — *what must happen, in what order, with what evidence.* Phases, gates,
   artifact chain, state model, provenance, ownership, definition of done.
3. **`MANUAL_STANDARD.md`** — *how a manual is built.* Markers, hierarchy, commentary, slides,
   content standard, report protocol, model tiering.

Then, for the book in hand:

4. **`{NN.Curso}/spec.md`** — the book specification.
5. **`{NN.Curso}/blocks.md`** — its literary-unit inventory.
6. **`{NN.Curso}/state.yaml`** — its workflow state. The Manager is authoritative; never infer
   state from conversation history.

If a rule you need is not in one of those, it is not a rule yet. Ask; do not invent it.

The agents, commands and skills are reachable from any workspace: `~/.cursor/agents`,
`~/.cursor/commands` and `~/.cursor/skills` are **symlinks** into `herramientas/CGV-curriculo`.
Edit the files there, never through the symlink path, and never make a second copy.

## Never

- Write a stage output into `cgv-reader`. That repo owns the Reader, Observer and Compiler
  applications and is a read-only consumer of published data — see its `DATA_CONTRACT.md`.
- Take a skeleton or a manuscript from `~/Downloads`. Compiler exports land in
  `{NN.Curso}/skeleton/`; manuscripts live in `{NN.Curso}/manual/`.
- Repair an upstream defect downstream. Flag it to the stage that owns it.

## The four things that matter most

- **A script and a reading are two different witnesses. Neither is the gate alone.** If they
  disagree, the verdict is blocked. Never report a script PASS as a verdict.
- **No agent verifies its own claims.** Verification always belongs to a different agent than
  authorship.
- **Authority is enforced, not requested.** `check-authority.py` diffs before/after and fails any
  change outside your clearance. You do not get to explain yourself.
- **A manual is not complete because an AI says so.** It is complete when it satisfies its
  specification and passes every required gate. Default status is NOT RELEASED.
