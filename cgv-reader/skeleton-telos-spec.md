# Skeleton / Telos — Design Spec

Handoff notes from a design session. Written for whoever implements this next (Claude Code
or a teammate) so the reasoning survives, not just the conclusions.

---

## Context

The Reader (`cgv-reader`) already has a working pipeline: finite verbs (Brick 1) → clauses
(Clause Builder, student selects the word span belonging to each finite verb) → mood
(commands/statements, Brick 2) → dependent-clause review (three yes/no questions per clause,
already implemented in `SpanishClauseBuilder.tsx`).

What doesn't exist yet: turning that review into a **skeleton** (indented structure), an
**outline** (the book's independent clauses in sequence), and a **telos** (the book's stated
purpose). This spec covers that missing piece, plus corrections found while prototyping it.

Everything here is downstream of the project's existing principle, stated in `README.md`:
*"Nothing depends upon hidden AI reasoning. The student should always be able to see exactly
what has been observed and how it was produced."* Every rule below exists to protect that.

## The three questions (corrected)

Asked in order, for every finite-verb clause. First "yes" wins; if all three are "no," the
clause is independent (root).

**Q1 — Does this clause describe a noun?**
If yes: **the student selects the actual noun** in the surrounding text (a word span) — *not*
a clause from a list. The software then looks up whether that noun falls inside a clause
that already has a row:
- If yes → nest this clause under that row.
- If no (the noun sits in material not yet placed — e.g. a verbless unit, see below) →
  park this clause visibly with a label like *"describes a noun not yet placed in the
  skeleton,"* rather than forcing an attachment to the nearest available row.

This is the one correction from the original design. Q1 was briefly changed to "pick a
parent clause, like Q2/Q3" for data-shape consistency — that was wrong. A description
clause modifies a *word*, not a clause, and the word doesn't always live inside an
indexed clause. Forcing it into a clause-picker produces a false attachment. (Caught live
in testing: "which God... promised" modifies "eternal life," a noun that lives in the
verbless 1:1 material, not in any clause on the list.)

**Q2 — Is this the content of what someone said, thought, wanted, or commanded?**
If yes: student picks the parent clause from a list (the clause containing the verb of
saying/thinking/wanting/commanding). Same interaction as before — no change.

**Q3 — Does this clause give the time, reason, condition, or purpose for another clause?**
If yes: student picks the parent clause. The specific frame type (time / reason / condition
/ purpose) is derived automatically from the clause's opening word — not asked as a fourth
question. Lookup table (Greek particle → type):

| Type      | Particles                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| purpose   | ἵνα, ὅπως                  |
| reason    | γάρ, διότι, ὅτι*            |
| condition | εἰ, ἐάν                     |
| time      | ὅτε, ὡς, ἐπεί               |

**\*Known open problem, unresolved by this spec:** ὅτι genuinely introduces both content
clauses (Q2) and reason clauses (Q3) in Greek, and nothing about the word itself
disambiguates — it depends on the governing verb, which is exactly what Q3 is supposed to
help a student discover, creating a circularity. This needs to be worked out by your Greek
students against real text, not decided in software. Flagging it here so it isn't lost:
**do not silently resolve this ambiguity in code — surface it to the student as a genuine
judgment call when it occurs.**

---

## Verbless nominal clauses (e.g. Titus 1:1a, Παῦλος δοῦλος Θεοῦ)

Greek regularly omits the copula in identity/apposition statements. These have no finite
verb, so Brick 1 never picks them up, and they are **not part of the skeleton pass at all.**

Do not invent a category for them now. Show them, visibly, as excluded from this pass
(e.g. a "no finite verb — set aside for the detailed pass" note), and leave them alone.
They get attached later, during detailed clause-level work, once the skeleton around them
is already fixed. Deciding their grammatical role now, before the skeleton exists, risks
forcing the structure to fit a premature decision rather than the other way around.

---

## H0 — not part of the software

H0 (the general theme / working title of the book) is **not data.** It is not a field, not
stored, not compared against anything by the software. It's the ordinary orientation a
reader already has after reading the book once, before any mechanical work starts. Its only
role is regulative: if the derived skeleton/telos ends up feeling structurally strange, that's
a cue for the *student* to recheck their mechanical work (a mistagged mood, a wrong
attachment) — not something the software checks, computes, or surfaces. **Do not build an
H0 input field.** This was proposed mid-session and correctly rejected — noting it here so
it isn't accidentally reintroduced.

## Deriving skeleton / outline / telos (pure arithmetic once the above is correct)

- **Skeleton** = every clause rendered at its indent depth, where depth = number of parent
  hops to root, walking the `parentClauseId` chain. Nest children directly under parents
  (not flat document order) — this is standard in phrase-line/arcing style diagramming.
- **Outline** = clauses with no parent (root), listed in book order.
- **Telos** = clauses where `relation === "frame"` and `frameType === "purpose"`, in book
  order. First one is the candidate telos. **Do not auto-conclude a match.** Show it next
  to the outline's last root clause and let the student judge the fit — computing a
  similarity score or declaring "confirmed" would be exactly the kind of hidden reasoning
  the project's philosophy rules out.

## Hard rule learned from prototyping: never build clause text from free translation

The prototype (Titus 1:1–5, hand-written English) produced two real bugs, both from the
same cause:
1. A clause folded a parent's finite verb and a content clause's finite verb into one
   line ("Paul mentioned that he would visit soon" — two verbs, one row).
2. An adjective (ἀψευδής, "the ever-truthful") got translated into English as a relative
   clause ("who never lies"), inventing a finite verb that doesn't exist in the Greek.

Both were caught by a human reviewer working the three-question flow correctly — the
*method* worked; the *data* was corrupted upstream. This is exactly why the real app never
lets a clause be built from free prose — it's built by selecting actual tagged source
tokens. **Any test data going forward (including anything used to test this feature) must
be built from the real morphology/alignment files, not hand-written translations.**

Files referenced by the existing code but not present in the uploaded zip, needed to test
against real data:
- `../../../cgv-data/bibles/NBLA/tito.nbla.md`
- `../../../cgv-data/morphology/MorphGNT/77-Tit-morphgnt.txt`
- `../../MNA/datasets/interlinear/NT/tito.tokens.jsonl`
- `cgv-bible` npm package (referenced as `file:../cgv-bible`)

## Existing types to extend, not replace

From `clause-data.ts` / `SpanishClauseBuilder.tsx` — reuse these shapes:

```ts
type ObservationAnswer = "yes" | "no" | "unsure";

interface ClauseObservation {
  describesNoun?: ObservationAnswer;
  describedNounSpan?: string[];       // Q1 — word span, NOT a clause id (see correction above)
  isWhatWasExpressed?: ObservationAnswer;
  expressedParentClauseId?: string;   // Q2
  tellsWhenOrIf?: ObservationAnswer;  // Q3 (rename/extend to cover reason & purpose, not just when/if)
  whenIfParentClauseId?: string;      // Q3
}
```

New, needed:
- A resolved `parentClauseId` per clause once Q1's noun-span is joined against existing
  clause spans (the lookup described under Q1 above).
- A `frameType` field (`"purpose" | "reason" | "condition" | "time"`) derived from the
  Greek opening token when Q3 is "yes" — via the particle lookup table above.
- Render functions for indent depth, outline extraction, and telos extraction — all pure
  functions over the existing `assignments`/`observations` data, no new storage needed
  beyond what's listed.

## Prototype for reference

An HTML/JS interaction prototype (no build step) was built during this session to test the
flow with sample data — useful for seeing the intended interaction, **not** for its sample
text (which is known to be flawed per the section above). Rebuild its data from real tagged
Titus text before trusting any output from it.
